# Feather Wallet

Feather is a free Monero desktop wallet for Linux, Tails, macOS and Windows. It is written in C++ with the Qt framework.

- **easy-to-use**, **small** and **fast** - Feather runs well on any modern hardware, including virtual machines and live operating systems.
- **beginner friendly**, but also caters to advanced Monero users by providing a [feature set](https://docs.featherwallet.org/guides/features) that is on par with the official CLI.
- ships with **sane defaults** that suit most users, but can also be configured for high or uncommon threat models.
- serves as a testing grounds for **experimental features** that may later be adopted in the reference wallets.
